# Google Homepage Clone

This project is a clone of the Google homepage, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal is to showcase skills in core web technologies, including HTML semantics, CSS styling and responsiveness, JavaScript functionality, API integration, and more.

## Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS styling and responsiveness
- JavaScript functionality for search and navigation
- Fully functional search allowing users to lookup queries
- Modular, commented code
- Live site deployment and GitHub version control

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-homepage-clone.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd google-homepage-clone`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter your search query in the input field.
2. Click the "Google Search" button to initiate the search.
3. The search results will be displayed on the page or redirected to the actual search results page (depending on your implementation).

## Implementation Details

### HTML

- Semantic structure using elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
- Navigation links for other Google services (e.g., Gmail, Images).
- Search input field and buttons in the main content area.
- Footer links for additional information or services.

### CSS

- Styling and layout using CSS, replicating the Google homepage design.
- Flexbox and CSS Grid techniques for positioning elements.
- Responsive design principles for different screen sizes and devices.
- Use of CSS preprocessor (e.g., Sass or Less) for better code organization.

### JavaScript

- Event handling for search input field and form submission.
- Integration with a search API (e.g., Google Custom Search API or third-party API).
- Fetching and displaying search results or providing a link to the actual search results page.
- Additional functionality like dropdown menus or tooltips.

### Live Site and Version Control

- The project is hosted on a live site using a service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
- GitHub is used for version control, and the code is regularly committed and pushed to the repository.
